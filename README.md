# Visual-Interfaces-Proj2

The aim of this project was to identify the top three most similar images for each of the 40 photos in the set included in this repository. I created an output chart in HTML format that displays the target photo in the leftmost column, with the next three columns showing the most similar, second most similar, and third most similar images, respectively.

To determine the rankings of the images, I utilized three metrics: color similarity, textural similarity, and shape similarity. I developed individual scripts to compute each of these metrics, and then combined them into a single simplex vector. This vector was used to rank the images based on their overall similarity to the target photo.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the project, I have included both the individual scripts for each metric as well as the combined script that generates the rankings. Additionally, I have included the output HTML file in PDF format for your convenience.
